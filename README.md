## World Overshoot Day

Earth Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity’s demand for ecological resources (fish and forests, for instance) and services in a given year exceeds what Earth can regenerate in that year.

Andrew Simms originally conceived the concept of Earth Overshoot Day while working at the UK think tank New Economics Foundation.
